# Project Name

Weekend React Gallery

## Description

This Project took me a weekend to create.

I created an app with react that has a gallery of pictures that are displayed on the DOM.
When the user clicks the picture, a description of the picture shows up.  The users is able to
toggle back and forth between picture and description. They can add their own picture and description. 
They can also like a picture or remove a picture.

##Installation
Here are the steps to get this app running on your own machine:

Create a database named react_gallery,
The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!


##Built With
CSS/HTML
