# Project Name

Weekend React Gallery

## Description

I created an app with react that has a gallery of pictures that are displayed on the DOM.
When the user clicks the picture, a description of the picture takes the pictures place.
The user can add their own picture and description. 
The user can also like a picture or remove a picture.
