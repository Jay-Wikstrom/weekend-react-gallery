# Project Name

Weekend React Gallery

## Description

This Project took me a weekend to create.

I created an app with react that has a gallery of pictures that are displayed on the DOM.
When the user clicks the picture, a description of the picture shows up.  The users is able to
toggle back and forth between picture and description. They can add their own picture and description. 
They can also like a picture or remove a picture.
